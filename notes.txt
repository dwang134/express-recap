a router is a way for you to create a specific object to serve under
one specific route

PROS of using express:

1. sending response is much more simple. You can specify the status type as well as the status
json body you are returning in one line whereas in node you have to do writhead and then do res.send

2. creating route objects for specific routes. More modularity and clarity.

3. allows you to have REST methods on one single instance using .route object
saves you time instead of retyping the same route over and over again

4. middlewares are powerful, code that runs after the request and before the response

TIPS:

1. always put static routes before dynamic routes because express reads from top to bottom, as soon as an available route
is found then it will use that

2. .params() middleware allows you to get the object with corresponding indicie with ease
simple assign req.objName = array[paramValue] and whenever you console.log out req.objName
you will get back the object you want

3. express does not allow you to access req.body directly you will have to use a middleware
